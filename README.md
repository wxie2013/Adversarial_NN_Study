# Adversarial_NN_Study
study the adversarial attack from various NN the starting point is to come up with a few simple neural networks, i.e. RBF, dense, CNN, from keras and tensorflow to train and attach handwritten digit. The final goal of of this study is to come up with a new architecture that's stable against adversarial attack.
